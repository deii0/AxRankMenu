# 🎉 AxRankMenu v1.0.0-deii0 - Major Update!

## 📢 What's New?

We're excited to announce a **major custom update** to AxRankMenu with two game-changing features that will revolutionize how players progress on the server!

---

## ✨ New Features

### 🏆 **Grindable Ranks System**
Players can now earn ranks automatically just by playing on the server!

**How it works:**
- Simply play on the server and accumulate playtime
- When you reach specific milestones, you'll automatically receive rewards
- No need to purchase anything - just dedication and loyalty!
- Your playtime is tracked permanently, even across server restarts

**Example Grindable Ranks:**
- 🔹 **VETERAN** - Unlocked after 7 days of playtime
  - Speed II for 3 days
  - Night Vision I for 3 days
  
- 🌟 **LEGEND** - Unlocked after 30 days of playtime
  - Speed II (essentially permanent - 1 year)
  - Regeneration I for 7 days
  - Strength I for 7 days

### 💫 **Persistent Effects System**
Long-duration potion effects that actually persist!

**What makes this special:**
- Effects last for **DAYS**, not just minutes or hours
- Effects survive server restarts
- Effects survive logout/login
- No more losing your rank perks when you disconnect
- Automatically reapplied when you join

**How it works:**
When you purchase or unlock a rank, you'll receive powerful effects that last for days or even months, not just the standard Minecraft duration.
